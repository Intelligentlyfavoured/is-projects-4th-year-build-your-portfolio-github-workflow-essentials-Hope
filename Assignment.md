## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

### What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned

#### 1. Concept: Branching

**Expectation ðŸ‘€**: I assumed branching was overkill for a solo projectâ€”just something large teams use to avoid stepping on each otherâ€™s toes.
**Reality ðŸ˜…**: Branching became my safety net! It allowed me to experiment confidently without messing up the main site.
**Impact ðŸ’¡**: I used branches like `feature/home-page` and `feature/about-section` to organize work and merge only when I was sure everything looked right.

#### 2. Concept: Commit Messages & Issue References

**Expectation ðŸ‘€**: I thought commit messages were just a formalityâ€”and referencing issues? Probably not needed for a small assignment.
**Reality ðŸ˜…**: Writing clear, purposeful messages and linking them to issues (e.g., `feat: add intro (#1)`) made my history super readable and auto-closed issues like magic!
**Impact ðŸ’¡**: I now see commit messages as part of the documentation. They helped me explain changes, track progress, and stay accountable.

---

#### 3. Concept: Pull Requests

**Expectation ðŸ‘€**: I figured pull requests (PRs) were only useful when collaborating with others.
**Reality ðŸ˜…**: PRs helped me pause and review my own work before merging. They also created a nice record of progress and made it easier to share feedback with my instructor.
**Impact ðŸ’¡**: Using PRs gave me confidence that every piece of code was reviewedâ€”even if just by meâ€”and prevented sloppy mistakes from creeping in.

#### 4. Concept: Milestones & GitHub Issues

**Expectation ðŸ‘€**: I thought issues and milestones were more for managing big teams or corporate sprints.
**Reality ðŸ˜…**: Surprisingly, breaking down my tasks into issues and grouping them under the `v1.0 Portfolio Launch` milestone kept me focused and organized.
**Impact ðŸ’¡**: My project stayed on track with clear deliverables. The June 30, 2025 deadline didnâ€™t sneak up on me thanks to that roadmap.
